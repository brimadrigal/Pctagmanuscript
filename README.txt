*_acoustics.mat = acoustic information only, pre-synthesis with kinematic data.
*_acoustics_kinematics.mat = acoustics synthesized with other sensors (e.g. speed, dive states) from the PRH file. Output from FlukeOverlay Code. Includes time between tag on/off.
*_acoustics_kinematics_callsonly.mat  only includes rows with calls.
*_acoustics_kinematics_callsonly.mat = only includes the time from tag on to tag off.
