Selection Type - 
S: signal (just signal - no buffer)
C: call (with buffer)

Animal - 
F: focal
NF: non focal
U - unsure will need to designate based on SNR

Clicks - 
R: rasp; uncountable
0: no clicks
empty: clicks present; number to be inserted later when calculated

Click Association - 
C: clicks associated with call
R: regular clicks overlap with call
U: unsure if clicks associated with call (e.g. overlapping clicks with another call or background buzzing makes it unclear)

Secondary sidebands - 
P: present
A: absent

Overlap - 
1- no overlap with focal contour but non-focal signal in box (added K for keep at the end if focal overlap in box is not major and could still be included)
2 - overlap OF focal contour with non-focal signal
3- no overlap with focal contour but potentially non focal overlap in box
4- overlap with focal contour with contour that is also potentially non-focal so unclear which is the focal signal.

B - Buzz present
R - Remove (clicks hard to tell which belongs to which)
C - background clicks

Audio Cut-Out - 
Y: yes occurring

Loud Background - 
Y: yes occurring

Chaos -
P: present

Sequence - 
fractions (e.g. 1/3,2/3,3/3)

Call Type - Final - 
based on call catalog
